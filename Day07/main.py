# Day 7 - Loops and Iterations
# Today we learned about for loops, while loops, and iterating over different data types.

# For loop example
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# While loop example
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count += 1

# Using range in for loop
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Number: {i}")
