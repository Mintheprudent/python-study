# ✅ Day 6 - Making Your Code Think 💭 (조건문 배우기)

Today was all about teaching Python how to **make decisions** using conditions. This is the logic behind every “if this, then that” behavior in programs.

## 📚 What I Learned

- The basic `if` statement
- `else` for when the condition isn’t true
- `elif` for multiple choices
- Nesting if-statements (if inside another if)

---

## 🤔 Why Is This Important?

Conditional logic is what makes our code **smart**. Without it, everything would just run line by line without any decisions — and that’s not how real-world problems work.

## 🧪 Code Breakdown

### Basic if

```python
weather = "rainy"
if weather == "rainy":
    print("Bring an umbrella!")
