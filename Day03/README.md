# 🌤️ Day 3 - elif, and making smarter decisions!

Today was all about adding more **layers** to our logic. Instead of just `if` and `else`, we learned how to use `elif` — short for "else if" — to handle more than two outcomes.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use `elif` for more complex branching
- Nesting `if` statements inside others
- Taking multiple inputs from the user to make decisions
- Writing code that feels a bit more “real world” — like weather apps!

## 🧪 Sample Code Explained

```python
if temp >= 30:
    print("It’s super hot. Don’t forget to drink water!")
elif temp >= 20:
    print("Perfect weather. Maybe go for a walk?")
elif temp >= 10:
    print("Bit chilly. Wear something warm.")
else:
    print("Freezing! Bundle up like a penguin!")
