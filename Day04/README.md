Today's lesson was all about **logic** — combining conditions and making more realistic decisions in code.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use comparison operators (`<`, `>=`, `==`, etc.)
- How to combine conditions using `and`, `or`, and `not`
- How to write real-world decision logic (discounts, ride access, etc.)
