## 📚 What I Learned

- How to define a basic function using `def`
- How to use parameters to customize behavior
- How to return results from a function
- That a function can even return **multiple values**!

## 🤔 Why Use Functions?

Imagine writing the same logic over and over again. Gross, right? Functions help you:
- Avoid repetition
- Make code easier to test and read
- Break problems into small, manageable pieces
