# Day 1 - Variables & Data Types

## ðŸ§  What I Learned Today

Today was all about **variables** and **basic data types** in Python.

I practiced how to:
- Declare variables
- Use strings, integers, and booleans
- Print out variable values
- Check data types using the `type()` function

## ðŸ¤” Why Does It Matter?

Variables are basically the *building blocks* of programming. Without them, there's no way to store or work with data. So learning this is the absolute foundation.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- A **variable** is like a label for a value. You can change it later.
- Python has different **data types** like:
  - `str` for text (e.g., `"dog"`)
  - `int` for numbers (e.g., `3`)
  - `bool` for True/False logic (e.g., `True`)
- You can reassign a variable at any time â€” it's super flexible.

## âœ¨ What Was Confusing?

Not much yet! It was simple but fun. I liked changing values and seeing how the output changed. Looking forward to doing more logic later on!
