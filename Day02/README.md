# 🚀 Day 2 - User Input & Conditionals

Today was all about **talking to the user** and **making decisions** based on what they type in.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to get user input using `input()`
- How to convert input into numbers using `int()`
- Writing conditional logic using `if`, `else`, and comparison operators
- Using the modulus operator (`%`) to check for even or odd numbers

## 🔍 Example Breakdown

```python
name = input("What’s your name? ")
print("Hi there, " + name + "!")
